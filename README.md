This is a simple CoffeeScript Node.js program
that is intended to be run periodically (cron)
to monitor the RSS feeds of a [Simple Machines
Forum](http://www.simplemachines.org/) (SMF)
and email all new articles discovered. A local
SQLite database is used to track which forums
to follow and their high-water marks.
